<h2>Pennies</h2>
<p>
The penny was one of the first coins minted. The United States first minted its one-cent piece, the penny, in 1793, a year after the mint first opened. Its design on the obverse was a woman with flowing hair, symbolizing liberty. The design on the reverse was a chain surrounding the words one cent and the fraction ¹/₁₀₀. It was called the large cent and because it was so big. This made it hard to use, so it was shrunk in 1857. This changed the look. The obverse was changed to a flying eagle and the reverse was changed to a wreath. In 1859 it was changed again. This time the obverse changed to Liberty with a headdress and the reverse stayed the same. In 1909 the obverse design was changed to the head of Abraham Lincoln to celebrate his 100th birthday. The reverse was changed to two sheaves of wheat. In 1959 the reverse was changed to the Lincoln Memorial to celebrate his 150th birthday. In 2009 the mint issued four coins that were part of the Lincoln Bicentennial One Cent Program. They celebrated Lincoln’s 200th birthday and the 100th anniversary of the Lincoln Cent. In 2010 the mint replaced the Lincoln Memorial with a shield.

<h2>Nickels</h2>
<p>
 The first five-cent piece was made of silver, not nickel. It was called a half disme. It was much smaller than the nickels we have today. From 1794-1837 the nickel had liberty on the obverse and an eagle on the reverse. In 1837 the wreath design took the place of the eagle. In 1866 the mint started to make different five cent coins composed of nickel and copper. People called these nickels. The mint didn’t discontinue the half dime until 1873. In 1913 the obverse design was replaced with a Native American Chief and the reverse design was replaced with a buffalo. Starting in 1938 the nickel contained Jefferson on the obverse and the Monticello on the reverse. In 2004 the mint created the Westward Journey Nickel Series. Then later in 2006 they made a new obverse based on a portrait of Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale. The obverse stayed the same except for the Monticello, which became more detailed.

<h2>Dimes</h2>
<p>
The first dimes, small silver coins, were minted in 1796. From 1796-1837 the dime had liberty on the obverse and an eagle on the reverse. In 1837 a wreath replaced the eagle. Liberty stayed on the coin until 1946. In 1965 silver was replaced with copper-nickel clad. From 1916-1945 the mint made the mercury dime. It was called the mercury dime because its obverse design resembled the Roman god Mercury. The bundle of rods around an ax and an olive vine symbolized the United States military readiness and its desire for peace. In 1946 the mint changed the obverse to FDR’s profile and the obverse to a torch, olive branch, and oak branch to symbolize liberty, peace, and strength.

<h2>Quarters</h2>
<p>
The first quarters were made of silver. From 1796-1930 the quarter had liberty on the obverse and an eagle on the reverse. From 1916 the mint made the Standing Liberty coin. It is one of the United State’s iconic coin designs. The obverse shows liberty coming through the opening in a wall and the reverse shows an eagle in flight. On Washington's 200th birthday in 1932 Washington replaced Liberty on the obverse and an eagle with wings spread replaced the eagle in flight. In 1965 silver was replaced with copper-nickel clad. During 1975-1976 the mint celebrated the Declaration of Independence by producing a coin with a colonial drummer and thirteen stars to represent the thirteen colonies. From 1999-2008 the mint made the US state quarters. During 2009 the mint produced the District of Columbia and U.S. Territories Quarters. From 2010-2021 the mint produced the America the Beautiful Quarters®. During 2021 the mint produced the General George Washington Crossing the Delaware Quarter. From 2022-2025 the mint is producing the American Women Quarters™.
